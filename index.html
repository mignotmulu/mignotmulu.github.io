    <h1>My awesome portfolio site</h1>
      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>I am a first-year student at The New School. I'm 19, a scorpio and 
      from Columbus, Ohio. I'm not a big fan of nature so I constantly find my friends
      trying to convince me that the beach isn't <q>nature</q>, but i'm not falling for it.
      I love memes and Boba, so the fact that there are at least 3 Boba tea shops on my block alone feels 
      like <strong>HEAVEN</strong>.</p>

      <h3>Why NYC?</h3>
      <p>I made the decision to go to New York for school at the end of my senior year of high school. 
      Growing up I always knew that I wanted to go as far away from home as possible for college, though 
      back then I thought I wanted to go to school anywhere in California. The New School and what they promoted 
      on their website made it seem like a dream school. With being accepted to TNS and the idea of being in THE New York 
      City, I knew I would regret passing up this opportunity, even if that meant going alone &#40;though I do have a friend 
      from home who goes to Pace University, but I don't see her as much as I expected to so it doesn't count haha&#41;.</p>

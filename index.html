        <p id="info">I'm a first-year student at The New School. I'm 19, a scorpio and 
        from Columbus, Ohio. I'm not a big fan of nature so I constantly find my friends
        trying to convince me that the beach isn't <q>nature</q>, but i'm not falling for it.
        I love memes, the moon, and Boba, so the fact that there are at least 3 Boba tea shops on 
        my block alone feels like <strong>HEAVEN</strong>. </p>

      <h3 class= "center" id="heading">Why NYC?</h3>
        <p id="info">I made the decision to go to New York for school at the end of my senior year of high school. 
        Growing up I always knew that I wanted to go as far away from home as possible for college, though back then 
        I thought I wanted to go to school anywhere in California. The New School and what they promoted on their 
        website made it seem like a dream school. With being accepted to TNS and the idea of being in THE New York City, 
        I knew I would regret passing up this opportunity, even if that meant going alone &#40;though I do have a friend 
        from home who goes to Pace University, but I don't see her as much as I expected to so it doesn't count haha&#41;.</p>

    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>I am a first-year student at The New School. I'm 19, a scorpio and 
      from Columbus, Ohio. I'm not a big fan of nature so most of my friends have 
      tried to convince me that the beach isn't nature, but i'm not falling for it.
      I love memes and Boba. Lol this feels like a bio for a dating site or something. </p>
